        <p>The staff were so friendly and welcoming and so we spend almost all our holiday at the hotel, restaurant, pool, bar and spa. Very nice breakfast and very good coffee served daily. We were simply amazed at how good the prices were for food and drinks. We went for swimming and relaxing to the pool almost every day and we loved it. They let us check in early and we had complementary champagne and fruit platter from the hotel! We loved it!</p>

        <p>All the staff were extremely helpful from the reception, cleaning, maintenance, pool staff without exception.
The close vicinity to the sea, sunbeds and umbrellas were very convenient. Night entertainment was enjoyable by the pool and we especially liked the fact that we could have a drink while our son played at the playground.</p>

        <p>Restaurant (breakfast and dinner)
        The high point of the hotel.
        Every structure around the restaurant and the food itself is very good, both for breakfast and dinner. The Chef in charge of the restaurant needs to be congratulated. Work careful and always to monitor during the meal periods everything that is done. Delicious food, varied, well made and with excellent presentation. Everything always fresh. Waitters are attentive and always very quick and professional at meal times.

      <p>The hotel was great from all perspectives.
It offers a lot of services including in the price, like indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and gym. There are also more services like massage with fare charge. The room was spacious and clean. The hotel’s restaurant/cafe/bar was really nice, the food very delicious and the prices normal. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast buffet was amazing and included a variety of salty and sweat choices. The breakfast takes place in the 5th floor of the hotel and from there the view to the sea is incredible.</p>
